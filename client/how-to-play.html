        <h1>How to Play</h1>

        <div>
            <h2>Overview<hr></h2>
            <p>Paint Chess is a chess variant where the pieces leave behind paint when they move.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>Differences<hr></h2>
            <p>
                The big difference with this variant is the paint mechanic. At the start of a game, 
                each player's pieces is assigned a color. When a player moves one of their pieces, 
                it leaves behind a paint trail along the path that it moved. This trail can stop opponent 
                pieces from moving through.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Since the colors are no longer white and black, the starting player is no longer determined by color.
                Rather, at the start of the game, each player is randomly designated as either Player 1 (P1) or Player 2 (P2). 
                The user designated as Player 1 always moves first and acts as if they were white in standard chess.
                You can tell what designation you received by looking at the additonal UI around the board.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>Rules<hr></h2>
            <p>
                This variant follows usual chess rules. A player can win if they checkmate the opponent  
                or if the opponent resigns. A player loses if they run out of time. No player wins if a stalemate occurs.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                All pieces except knights leave a trail over where they moved. Since knights jump over pieces, they only 
                leave a trail at the squares they moved from and where they landed.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                A piece cannot move go thorugh a square painted by the opponent's pieces. A piece can move 
                freely past unpainted and squares painted by your own pieces. A piece can paint over opponent paint 
                by moving to that square. Note that a piece can only paint over the opponent's paint 1 square at a 
                time.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>Examples<hr></h2>
            <p>
                This is an example of a game between a lime player (P1) and a purple player (P2).
                The orange player is P1 in this case, so they get to move first. Notice that 
                the squares under the player's pieces are painted, while the rest of the squares are 
                grayed out.
            </p>

            <p>
                P1 moved one of their pawns from e2 to e4, leaving behind a trail.
            </p>

            <p>
                P2 moved one of their pawns from from d7 to d5, also leaving behind a trail.
            </p>
            <img src="/public/images/how-to-play/trail-showcase-2.png" alt="moving player 2's pawn from d7 to d5 leaving behind a trail">

            <p>
                P1 moved their bishop from f1 to b5, leaving behind a diogonal trail. Note that P2's king is not in check in this variant, 
                in stark contrast to standard chess. This is because the attacking bishop would need to cross a square painted by the 
                opponent to actually reach the king which is against the rules of this variant, so P2's king is not in danger.
            </p>

            <p>
                P2 decides to move one of their knights and then P1 brings the bishop closer. Note that only now is P2's king 
                in check, since there are no opponent-painted squares between the P1 bishop and P2 king. 
            </p>

            <p>
                P2 caputures the attacking P1 bishop using the P2 queen. The trail left behind by P1's bishop remains.
